        <p id="floataboutme"> Hi, I'm Andrea! I'm originally from Virginia but moved to Atlanta Ga in the summer of 2020. I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2017 with a degree in Public Health but recently decided to change fields. I'm now studying to become a software engineer with Digitalcrafts in the Atlanta cohort. I love to bike and walk on the Atlanta trails. I also enjoy yoga and recently started dabbling in photography. Right now, I am most excited to dive more into software development and hopefully hone this new skill over the coming months.</p>
